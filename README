ACE (occasionally called hcs in development, as that's what it was originally
called internally) is a heraldic commenting system written specifically for
the use of the Kingdom of Ansteorra.  It's under GPL (see the file COPYING)
so you're free to use it and modify it for your own use.  You are not free
to depend on me to support it, particularly once you've modified it for your
own use, but if you'd like to get patches that can probably be arranged.  I
am exceptionally busy with other stuff so it's critical ACE not be a big
time sink.  Doubtless you understand.

That said, you can contact me at reis@hailmog.org.

This version is ACE designed for AEthelmearc; however, modifying config/config.yml and config/database.yml should be enough to enable it for another kingdom (at least to start).
